In this program, we take input from the user for their grade and assign it to the variable grade. The if-else if statement checks the value of grade and executes the corresponding block of code based on the conditions:

If grade is between 90 and 100 (inclusive), it prints "Your grade is A."
If grade is between 80 and 89 (inclusive), it prints "Your grade is B."
If grade is between 70 and 79 (inclusive), it prints "Your grade is C."
If grade is between 60 and 69 (inclusive), it prints "Your grade is D."
If grade is less than 60, it prints "Your grade is F."
If none of the above conditions are true, it executes the code inside the else block and prints "Invalid grade."
You can run this program and enter different grades to see the output based on the conditions specified in the if-else if statement.
