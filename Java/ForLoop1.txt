In this program, we demonstrate different use cases of the for loop:

Printing numbers from 1 to 5: The loop variable i starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 5.

Printing even numbers from 2 to 10: The loop variable i starts at 2 and increments by 2 in each iteration until it reaches 10.

Printing numbers in reverse order from 10 to 1: The loop variable i starts at 10 and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

Iterating over elements in an array: The loop variable i starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the length of the array. The loop is used to access and print each element in the numbers array.

You can run this program to see the output of each for loop scenario mentioned above.

Printing numbers from 1 to 5:

Iteration 1: i = 1
Iteration 2: i = 2
Iteration 3: i = 3
Iteration 4: i = 4
Iteration 5: i = 5
Printing even numbers from 2 to 10:

Iteration 1: i = 2
Iteration 2: i = 4
Iteration 3: i = 6
Iteration 4: i = 8
Iteration 5: i = 10
Printing numbers in reverse order from 10 to 1:

Iteration 1: i = 10
Iteration 2: i = 9
Iteration 3: i = 8
Iteration 4: i = 7
Iteration 5: i = 6
Iteration 6: i = 5
Iteration 7: i = 4
Iteration 8: i = 3
Iteration 9: i = 2
Iteration 10: i = 1
Iterating over elements in an array:

Iteration 1: i = 0, numbers[i] = 1
Iteration 2: i = 1, numbers[i] = 2
Iteration 3: i = 2, numbers[i] = 3
Iteration 4: i = 3, numbers[i] = 4
Iteration 5: i = 4, numbers[i] = 5
For each iteration, the loop variable i takes on different values based on the conditions specified in the for loop. These values are then used to perform various operations, such as printing numbers or accessing array elements, depending on the specific scenario of the loop.
