In this program, we take input from the user using the Scanner class to read an integer number. Here's how the program works:

We create a Scanner object to read input from the user.

The program prompts the user to enter a number using System.out.print().

We read the input from the user using scanner.nextInt() and store it in the number variable.

We initialize the sum variable to 0, and the i variable to 1.

We use a while loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to the entered number:

The loop continues as long as the condition i <= number is true.
In each iteration, we add the current value of i to sum and update the sum value.
We increment i by 1 in each iteration.
After the loop finishes, we print the calculated sum using System.out.println().

When you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a number. It will then calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to the entered number using a while loop and display the result.

For example, if you enter 5, the output will be:

The sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is: 15

This program demonstrates how the while loop can be used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. In this case, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number.
