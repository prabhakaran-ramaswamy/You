In this program, we calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

Initializing Variables:

We declare and initialize the variable sum to 0. This variable will store the sum of numbers.
for Loop:

The loop variable i is initialized to 1.
The loop condition checks if i is less than or equal to 10.
In each iteration, the code block inside the loop is executed, which adds the value of i to the sum.
After each iteration, the loop variable i is incremented by 1.
After the for Loop:

Once the loop has finished executing, we print the final value of sum, which represents the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.
When you run this program, it will calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop and print the result as output.

In this example, the loop variable i takes on values from 1 to 10 in each iteration of the loop. The value of i is used to perform the addition operation and update the sum variable.

Iteration 1:

i = 1
sum = 0 + 1 = 1
Iteration 2:

i = 2
sum = 1 + 2 = 3
Iteration 3:

i = 3
sum = 3 + 3 = 6
Iteration 4:

i = 4
sum = 6 + 4 = 10
Iteration 5:

i = 5
sum = 10 + 5 = 15
Iteration 6:

i = 6
sum = 15 + 6 = 21
Iteration 7:

i = 7
sum = 21 + 7 = 28
Iteration 8:

i = 8
sum = 28 + 8 = 36
Iteration 9:

i = 9
sum = 36 + 9 = 45
Iteration 10:

i = 10
sum = 45 + 10 = 55
After the loop finishes executing, the value of sum will be the sum of numbers from 1 to 10, which is 55.

Each iteration of the loop increments the loop variable i by 1 and adds the value of i to the sum variable. This process is repeated until the loop condition becomes false, which occurs when i is no longer less than or equal to 10.

The final value of sum represents the sum of numbers from 1 to 10, calculated using the for loop.
