In this program, we take input from the user and assign it to the variable number. The if statement checks the value of number and executes the corresponding block of code based on the condition:

If number is greater than 0, it prints "The number is positive."
If number is less than 0, it prints "The number is negative."
If none of the above conditions are true, it prints "The number is zero."
You can run this program and enter different numbers to see the output based on the conditions specified in the if statement.
