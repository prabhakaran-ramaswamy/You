In this program, we prompt the user to enter a day number (1-7) and display the corresponding day name. Here's how the program works:

We create a Scanner object to read input from the user.

We prompt the user to enter a day number using System.out.print().

We read the user's input using scanner.nextInt() and store it in the dayNumber variable.

We declare a String variable dayName to hold the name of the day.

We use a switch statement to check the value of dayNumber and assign the corresponding day name to dayName:

If dayNumber is equal to 1, it assigns the value "Sunday" to dayName.
If dayNumber is equal to 2, it assigns the value "Monday" to dayName.
If dayNumber is equal to 3, it assigns the value "Tuesday" to dayName.
If dayNumber is equal to 4, it assigns the value "Wednesday" to dayName.
If dayNumber is equal to 5, it assigns the value "Thursday" to dayName.
If dayNumber is equal to 6, it assigns the value "Friday" to dayName.
If dayNumber is equal to 7, it assigns the value "Saturday" to dayName.
If dayNumber does not match any of the above cases, it assigns the value "Invalid day number" to dayName.
After executing the appropriate code block, the program exits the switch statement.

We print the day name corresponding to the entered day number using System.out.println().

When you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a day number. Based on your input, it will display the corresponding day name.

For example, if you enter 3, the output will be:

The day corresponding to 3 is Tuesday.

If you enter 8, the output will be:

The day corresponding to 8 is Invalid day number.

This program demonstrates how the switch statement can be used to select a code block based on the value of a variable. In this case, it allows the user to enter a day number and displays the corresponding day name.
