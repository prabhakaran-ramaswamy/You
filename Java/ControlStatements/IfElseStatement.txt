import java.util.Scanner;

public class IfElseStatementExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        if (age >= 18) {
            System.out.println("You are eligible to vote.");

            System.out.println("You are not eligible to vote.");

}

In this program, we take input from the user for their age and assign it to the variable age. The if-else statement checks the value of age and executes the corresponding block of code based on the condition:

If age is greater than or equal to 18, it prints "You are eligible to vote."
If the condition is not true (i.e., age is less than 18), it executes the code inside the else block and prints "You are not eligible to vote."
You can run this program and enter different ages to see the output based on the conditions specified in the if-else statement.
