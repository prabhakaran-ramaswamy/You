There are numerous computer languages, each with its own syntax, purpose, and features. Here are some popular programming languages:

Python: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a versatile scripting language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive web pages and is commonly used for front-end and back-end web development.

Java: Java is a widely adopted general-purpose programming language known for its "write once, run anywhere" principle. It is used in a variety of applications, from desktop software to enterprise-level systems.

C++: C++ is a powerful and efficient programming language used for system programming, game development, and other performance-critical applications. It is an extension of the C language and offers additional features like object-oriented programming.

C#: C# (pronounced C sharp) is a modern programming language developed by Microsoft. It is commonly used for Windows application development, game development with Unity, and building enterprise software.

Ruby: Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. It is often used in web development with the Ruby on Rails framework.

Swift: Swift is a programming language developed by Apple for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. It is designed to be safe, fast, and expressive.

Go: Go (or Golang) is a statically typed, compiled language developed by Google. It is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and built-in support for concurrency, making it suitable for building scalable systems and network applications.

PHP: PHP is a popular scripting language used primarily for web development. It is embedded within HTML and is often used to create dynamic web pages and build web applications.

Rust: Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, concurrency, and performance. It is designed to prevent memory errors and is often used for building low-level systems software and high-performance applications.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more programming languages available, each with its own strengths and areas of application. The choice of programming language depends on the specific requirements of a project or task at hand.
