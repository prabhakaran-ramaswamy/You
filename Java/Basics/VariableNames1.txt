In Java, variable names can consist of letters (uppercase or lowercase), digits, and underscores. However, they must follow certain naming conventions. Here's an example Java program that explains the possible variable names:

public class VariableNamesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Valid variable names
        int count = 10;
        String firstName = "John";
        double averageScore = 85.5;
        boolean isStudent = true;

        // Invalid variable names
        // int 123number = 123;  // Starts with a digit
        // String my-name = "Alice";  // Contains a hyphen
        // double average-score = 75.2;  // Contains a hyphen

        // Using underscores
        int max_value = 100;
        int min_value = 0;

        // Constants (final variables)
        final int MAX_SIZE = 1000;
        final double PI = 3.14159;

        // Multi-word variable names (camelCase)
        int studentCount = 20;
        double averageTestScore = 78.9;
        boolean hasPermissionToAccess = true;
    }
}



In this program, we have various variable names to demonstrate the possible naming conventions:

Valid Variable Names:

count: Represents a numeric value.
firstName: Represents a String value.
averageScore: Represents a floating-point number.
isStudent: Represents a boolean value.
Invalid Variable Names (commented out):

Variable names cannot start with a digit, such as 123number.
Variable names cannot contain a hyphen, such as my-name or average-score.
Using Underscores:

max_value and min_value demonstrate the use of underscores in variable names.
Constants (Final Variables):

MAX_SIZE and PI are declared as constants using the final keyword.
Multi-Word Variable Names (Camel Case):

studentCount, averageTestScore, and hasPermissionToAccess demonstrate the use of camel case to improve readability in multi-word variable names.
Note: It's important to choose meaningful and descriptive variable names that reflect the purpose and context of the variable.

By following the Java naming conventions, you can create variable names that are easy to read and understand, making your code more maintainable and readable.
