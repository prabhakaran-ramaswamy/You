In this program, we ask the user to guess a secret number and provide feedback until they guess the correct number. Here's how the program works:

We create a Scanner object to read input from the user.

We declare variables guess to store the user's guess and secretNumber to hold the secret number (in this example, the secret number is 42).

We use a do-while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess and provide feedback:

The loop executes at least once before checking the condition.
Inside the loop, we prompt the user to enter their guess using System.out.print().
We read the input from the user using scanner.nextInt() and store it in the guess variable.
Inside the loop, we check the user's guess against the secret number:

If the guess is less than the secret number, we inform the user that their guess is too low.
If the guess is greater than the secret number, we inform the user that their guess is too high.
If the guess is equal to the secret number, we congratulate the user for guessing the correct number.
The loop continues as long as the user's guess is not equal to the secret number (guess != secretNumber).

When you run this program, it will prompt you to guess the secret number. It will provide feedback based on your guess and continue until you guess the correct number.

For example, if you enter 50 as your guess, the program will print:

Too high! Try again.
If you then enter 30 as your guess, the program will print:

Too low! Try again.

Finally, if you enter 42 as your guess, the program will print:

Congratulations! You guessed the secret number.

This program demonstrates how the do-while loop can be used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. In this case, it allows the user to keep guessing the secret number until they guess it correctly.
