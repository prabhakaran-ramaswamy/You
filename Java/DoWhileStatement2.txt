In this program, we ask the user to enter numbers until they enter 0, and then calculate the sum of the entered numbers. Here's how the program works:

We create a Scanner object to read input from the user.

We declare variables sum to store the sum of the numbers entered and number to hold each number entered by the user.

We use a do-while loop to repeatedly ask the user for a number and add it to the sum:

The loop executes at least once before checking the condition.
Inside the loop, we prompt the user to enter a number using System.out.print().
We read the input from the user using scanner.nextInt() and store it in the number variable.
We add the entered number to the sum variable.
The loop continues as long as the user's input is not equal to 0 (number != 0).

After the loop finishes, we print the calculated sum using System.out.println().

When you run this program, it will repeatedly prompt you to enter a number until you enter 0. It will then calculate the sum of all the entered numbers and display the result.

For example, if you enter 5, 10, 3, and 0 as your numbers, the program will print:

Enter a number (enter 0 to exit): 5
Enter a number (enter 0 to exit): 10
Enter a number (enter 0 to exit): 3
Enter a number (enter 0 to exit): 0
The sum of the numbers is: 18

This program demonstrates how the do-while loop can be used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. In this case, it allows the user to enter numbers and calculates their sum until they enter 0 to exit.
