In this program, we use a double for loop to iterate through two variables, i and j. However, when both i and j equal 2, we use the break statement to terminate the inner loop. Here's how the program works:

We define an outer for loop that initializes the loop variable i to 1, checks the condition i <= 3, and increments i by 1 after each iteration.

Inside the outer loop, we define an inner for loop that initializes the loop variable j to 1, checks the condition j <= 3, and increments j by 1 after each iteration.

Inside the inner loop, we check if both i and j are equal to 2 using the if statement.

If both i and j are equal to 2, we encounter the break statement. This causes the inner loop to be terminated, and the program continues with the next iteration of the outer loop.

If the if condition is not met, the program will execute the code inside the inner loop, which prints the values of i and j.

After the inner loop finishes or is terminated by the break statement, the outer loop continues to the next iteration, and the process repeats.

Once the outer loop finishes iterating through all values of i, the program continues with the next statement, which prints "Double loop has ended."

When you run this program, it will iterate through both the outer and inner loops, printing the values of i and j for each iteration. However, when both i and j are equal to 2, the inner loop will be terminated by the break statement. The program will then continue with the next iteration of the outer loop.

The output of the program will be:

i: 1, j: 1
i: 1, j: 2
i: 1, j: 3
i: 2, j: 1
Double loop has ended.

This program demonstrates how the break statement can be used within a double for loop to prematurely terminate the inner loop based on a certain condition. In this case, the inner loop is terminated when both i and j are equal to 2.
